        <h3>PlayStation 5 (PS5)</h3>
        <p>
          The PlayStation 5 is my favourite “thing” right now because it blends performance, design, and an
          incredible game library into one device. What stands out most is how quick everything feels—the
          ultra-fast SSD means games load in seconds, so I spend more time playing and less time waiting.
          Combined with the DualSense controller's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, games feel more
          immersive than ever. Simple moments like feeling the tension while drawing a bowstring or the
          subtle vibrations of footsteps on different surfaces pull me deeper into the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like how the PS5 supports both fast-paced multiplayer and relaxing single-player experiences.
          On some days, I'll jump into a quick match with friends; on others, I'll explore story-driven
          adventures to unwind. The console is also a handy media hub—I can stream music, watch movies, or
          play YouTube tutorials without switching devices. This versatility makes it perfect for a student
          lifestyle because it covers entertainment, social connection, and even light learning in one place.
          I appreciate that it fits neatly into my setup, runs quietly, and looks clean on a desk or TV unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I like the PS5 because it gives me a balanced break between study and play. It's not
          just about graphics or specs—it's the overall experience. The combination of speed, controller feel,
          and great exclusives makes it a device I keep coming back to after long days. It's a favourite not
          just for what it does, but for how it fits into my daily routine and helps me relax while staying
          connected with friends.

        <h3>Playing Basketball</h3>
        <p>
          Basketball is my favourite activity because it combines fitness, strategy, and teamwork in a way
          that never feels repetitive. Whether it's a casual shoot-around or a friendly game with mates, I
          always leave the court feeling more energised and focused. I enjoy the rhythm of the game—moving
          without the ball, timing a cut, making a quick pass, or taking the right shot. It keeps my mind
          active and my body moving, which is perfect after long study sessions staring at a screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I value most is how social it is. Basketball gives me a simple way to connect with people from
          different backgrounds. You don't need much—just a ball and a hoop—so it's easy to organise and join.
          Even when I'm coming back from time off or managing a minor injury, there are ways to adapt: focus on
          shooting drills, free throws, or light conditioning. It's motivating to track progress over weeks and
          months, like improving footwork, building core strength, or tightening a jump-shot release.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like how the sport crosses into other parts of life. The discipline from training helps with
          time management; the teamwork carries into group projects; and the confidence from small wins
          translates into everyday challenges. Plus, it's just fun. Fresh air, a clear goal, and the feeling of
          swishing a clean shot—those moments make the effort worth it. Basketball keeps me grounded and gives
          me a healthy balance between study, social life, and personal growth.
