    <h2>Interesting Fun Facts About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I have always been fascinated by different cultures and experiences.
      One fun fact about me is that I can speak three languages: English, Arabic, and Dinka.
      Growing up in Kenya before moving to Australia in 2015 exposed me to diverse traditions, foods,
      and celebrations, and I enjoy sharing these stories with friends. Another fun fact is that I am a
      huge basketball fan. At 6'9”, I often surprise people when I tell them I can't dunk easily due to
      a knee injury, but I still enjoy playing casually with friends. I also love experimenting in the
      kitchen I once tried to recreate a traditional South Sudanese dish using only Australian
      ingredients, and while it wasn't perfect, it sparked my passion for cooking fusion meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not playing sports or coding, I enjoy drawing and digital art. I find it relaxing
      to create characters and bring them to life with cultural influences. I also enjoy exploring
      random trivia; for instance, did you know giraffes only sleep about 30 minutes a day?
      These quirky facts make conversations fun and remind me that there's always something new
      to learn.

    <h2>Skills Spotlight</h2>

    <h3>Unique Skills I Have Learned</h3>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've developed several skills that reflect both my academic journey and
      personal interests. One of my strongest skills is computer literacy. I am proficient in
      programming with Java and Python, building web pages using HTML and CSS, and creating
      diagrams for systems analysis such as ERDs, class diagrams, and statecharts. These skills
      not only help me academically but also prepare me for real-world IT roles. Beyond academics,
      I have also developed strong communication skills. Working at Dust Flowers and in customer
      service taught me how to interact with people clearly and effectively, whether face-to-face
      or through digital platforms. Another unique skill is teamwork I've participated in
      group assignments where collaboration and task-sharing were crucial to success. Finally,
      on a more casual side, I can cook a wide range of dishes and often surprise my friends
      with meals from different cultures, blending flavors and experimenting with recipes.
    </p>

    <h3>Unique Skills I Am Pursuing</h3>
    <p>
      While I am proud of the skills I already have, I am constantly working to improve and
      develop new ones. Currently, I am pursuing stronger skills in software development and
      problem-solving. I want to become confident in building full-stack applications that can
      solve real problems in industries like finance and healthcare. I am also working on
      improving my public speaking and presentation skills, as I believe that technical skills
      alone are not enough being able to communicate ideas clearly is equally important.
      Outside of IT, I am pursuing athletic skills as well. Basketball continues to be a sport
      I enjoy, and I am working on improving my endurance and strength to overcome past
      limitations. I am also pursuing creative skills such as digital art and storytelling,
      where I aim to create culturally inspired art that can reach wider audiences online.
      Pursuing these skills keeps me motivated and ensures I am always growing both personally
      and professionally.
