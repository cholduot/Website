    <h2>Circular Quay & The Rocks, Sydney</h2>
    <p>
      My favourite place I've visited in Sydney is the **Circular Quay & The Rocks area. It feels like the city's
      front porch—where ferries glide in, buskers build little crowds, and the skyline opens to the Harbour Bridge
      and the Opera House. I love arriving by train and stepping straight into the light: sea breeze in the air,
      gulls circling, and the water catching reflections from the ferries. It's an easy place to wander without a plan:
      follow the promenade toward the Opera House, loop back through First Fleet Park, then climb into The Rocks where
      sandstone lanes, terrace houses, and tiny courtyards make it feel like an older city hiding inside the modern one.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes it special to me is how the mood changes across the day. In the morning, it's calm—runners and
      commuters move with purpose and cafés warm up the corners. At sunset, the harbour switches on: colours deepen,
      the Bridge turns into a silhouette, and the Opera House sails glow against the sky. You can walk across the bridge
      to Milsons Point for a different angle, or just sit on the steps and watch ferries draw lines across the water.
      Even without spending anything, there's always something to do: people-watch, sketch the skyline, take long-exposure
      photos, or map out the next walk. It's a place that makes you feel like you're part of Sydney, even if you're only
      passing through for an hour.
    </p>

      I like it because it's a perfect balance of energy and ease. The history in The Rocks gives it texture; the open
      harbour gives it space. It's both iconic and personal: the same view everyone knows, but different every time you
      go—new weather, new buskers, new ships, new crowds. Whenever friends visit, this is where I take them first, not
      just to tick a box, but because it captures what I enjoy most about the city: movement, music, and water all in one
      frame.
